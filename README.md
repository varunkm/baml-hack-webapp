# Portfolio Risk Calculator [PoC]

Proof of concept application developed at a recent hackathon sponsored by Bank of America Merril Lynch. The purpose of the application is  to allow casual investors to compute various risk metrics for their portfolio, saving them time and effort. 

The ultimate intention for the application would be to suggest a portfolio for an investor that is dependant on their stated risk profile, and allow the investor to see how different additions to their portfolio would change their overall risk.
